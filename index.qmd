*PhD candidate*   
Modelling and Simulation Research Group  
[Centre for Complex Systems](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/complex-systems.html)  
The University of Sydney

My research leverages **Agent-Based Computational Economics**[^1] to explore how democratic 
and cooperative decision-making and ownership structures in organisations impact 
the economy at large. By integrating concepts from social psychology into the 
decision-making of individual agents in economic models, we can improve the 
real-world fidelity of the models and see how more **participatory organizational forms** 
influence factors such as market dynamics and wealth distribution.
