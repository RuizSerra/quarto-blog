### Auto Espresso

[Auto Espresso](https://www.instagram.com/autoespresso/) was a specialty coffee bar within [Autonomy Clothing](https://www.instagram.com/autonomyclothing/)'s Melbourne CBD flagship store. Our coffee and friendliness was a favourite amongst both shoppers and employees at the Emporium in Melbourne.

I was on the "cover" of a print run of leaflets for the [Emporium Melbourne](https://www.emporiummelbourne.com.au/).
