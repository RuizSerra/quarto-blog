TL;DR: By factorising the generative model of AIF agents, they can maintain individual beliefs about others while planning strategically in a joint context. We employ game transitions to induce non-stationarity in agent preferences and study the resultant adaptive behaviour at the individual and collective levels. Bridging cognitive process models (AIF) with economic/MAS models (game theory) shows potential for understanding collective intelligence and designing interventions.
